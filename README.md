# ahkpm - The AutoHotKey Package Manager.

[AutoHotKey][ahk] is a powerful tool for scripting automations on Windows,
but managing dependencies for your scripts is painful.
`ahkpm` intends to bring modern package management to AutoHotkey,
making it easier than ever to automate away the drudgery.

## Commands

- [x] `ahkpm init`: Interactively create an `ahkpm.json` file in the current directory
- [x] `ahkpm install github.com/user/repo`: Installs a package and records it in `ahkpm.json` (other git hosts to come later)
- [ ] `ahkpm install`: Reinstalls all dependencies listed in `ahkpm.json`
- [ ] `ahkpm update <name>`: Updates installed packages to the newest version
- [ ] `ahkpm list`: List local packages and their installed versions
- [x] `ahkpm help`: Provides documentation
- [ ] `ahkpm selfupdate`: Upgrade to the latest version of ahkpm
- [ ] `ahkpm version`
